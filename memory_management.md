# ðŸ§  Python Memory Management and GIL Explained

This document outlines the complete lifecycle of a Python object â€” from variable declaration to memory deallocation â€” and how Python's memory management and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) play into it.

## ðŸ“Œ A Day in the Life of a Python Variable

### Step 1: Variable Declaration

```python
x = 100
```

- Python checks for object reusability (e.g., small integers).
- If not reusable, a new object is created in the private heap.
- Memory is allocated via `pymalloc` for small objects.
- A symbol `x` is created pointing to the object.

---

### Step 2: Memory Management Begins

Each Python object has:
- A reference count
- A type pointer
- A value pointer

Example:

```python
import sys
print(sys.getrefcount(x))
```

---

### Step 3: Reference Counting

```python
y = x
```

- Increases reference count to 2.
- `del x` decreases it to 1.
- `del y` decreases it to 0, triggering deallocation.

---

### Step 4: Garbage Collection

Used for **cyclic references**:

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.link = self
```

- Python's `gc` module uses **generational GC** (Gen 0, 1, 2).
- Triggered automatically or manually via `gc.collect()`.

---

### Step 5: GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)

- Ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
- Simplifies memory safety and reference counting.
- Limits true multithreading in CPU-bound programs.

Workarounds:
- Use `multiprocessing` for parallelism.
- Use native C extensions (e.g., NumPy).
- Use Cython with `nogil` blocks.

## ðŸ”„ Timeline Summary

| Step | What Happens | Involves |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Declaration | Object created in memory | pymalloc, heap |
| Reference | `x`, `y` point to same object | ref count +1 |
| Deletion | Ref count drops | dealloc if 0 |
| Cycles | GC detects and clears | generational GC |
| Threads | GIL locks execution | one thread runs |
