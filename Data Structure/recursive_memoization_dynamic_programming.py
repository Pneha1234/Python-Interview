# two common problem in dynamic programming: Longest subsequences and knapsack problems
# Question 1: Write a function to find the length of the longest common subsequences between two sequences. Eg Given the
# strings "serendipitous" and "precipitation", the longest common subsequences is "reipito" and the length is 7

# A " sequence" is a group of items with a deterministic ordering. Lists, tuples and ranges are some common sequence
# types in Python

# A "subsequnce" is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more elements from another sequence. For example, "edpt" is
# a subsequence os "serendipitious"

def len_lcs(seq1, seq2):
    pass

# Test Cases:
#1. General case(string)
#2. General case(list)
#3. No common subsequences
#4. One is a subsequences of the other
#5. One sequence is empty
#6. Both sequence are empty
#7. Multple subsequences with the same length
